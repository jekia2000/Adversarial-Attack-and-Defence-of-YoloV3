# Adversarial-Attack-and-Defence-of-YoloV3
This project was my Bachelor's Thesis. It consists of developing an adversarial attack and defense against it on YoloV3, as well as some benchmarking. The project was developed on Linux, but can easily be used on Windows by changing the pickle import libabry and converting bash files into batch files. The instructions for Linux are given in the Guidelines. More about the project and yielded results can be read in the Final Report.
